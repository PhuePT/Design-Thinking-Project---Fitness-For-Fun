# Design-Thinking-Project---Fitness-For-Fun
Design Thinking Project - Fitness App 



The "Fitness for Fun" project leveraged the design thinking process to create a mobile application that addresses the fitness needs of CSULA students. The Empathize phase involved collecting data through surveys and interviews, uncovering the challenges students face in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. During the Define phase, these insights were distilled into a clear problem statement, emphasizing issues like time constraints and lack of motivation. The Ideate phase focused on generating various potential solutions, leading to the concept of a centralized fitness app. In the Prototype stage, low-fidelity sketches and high-fidelity designs were developed using Figma and Canva, followed by a functional prototype in Xcode. Finally, the Testing phase involved presenting the prototype to other student teams for feedback, which informed refinements and enhancements. This iterative approach ensured the final solution was user-centric, effectively promoting fitness through an engaging and accessible platform.
